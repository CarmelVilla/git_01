## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves       
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,     
And the mome raths outgrabe.  

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Nature’s first green is gold,  
Her hardest hue to hold.  
Her early leaf’s a flower;  
But only so an hour.  
Then leaf subsides to leaf.  

## Third Verse

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

Amidst the stars that softly gleam,   
A universe of dreams unseen,       
In shadows deep and realms afar,      
Where wishes dance, like fireflies' spar.  

The moon, a beacon in the night,  
A silver coin of ancient light,  
It weaves a tale of love and lore,  
As whispered secrets grace the shore.  

Through whispered winds and rustling leaves,  
The heart's desires, like autumn weaves,  
In colors bold and richly spun,  
A tapestry beneath the sun.  

Oh, how the rivers gently flow,  
Their stories ancient, ages ago,  
Carving pathways through the land,  
A lifeline drawn by nature's hand.  

Upon the mountains towering high,  
Where eagles spread their wings and fly,  
A symphony of heights untold,  
In nature's grasp, a story bold.  

And as the seasons come and go,  
A rhythmic dance, a ceaseless flow,  
We find our place within this scheme,  
A part of life's eternal dream.  

So let us cherish every day,  
In this grand world, where we find our way,  
With open hearts and spirits free,  
We'll write our own destiny.
